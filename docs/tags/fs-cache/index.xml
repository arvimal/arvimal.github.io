      <description>FS-Cache and CacheFS. Are there any differences between these two? Initially, I thought both were same. But no, it&amp;rsquo;s not.
CacheFS is the backend implementation which caches the data onto the disk and mainpulates it, while FS-Cache is an interface which talks to CacheFS.
So why do we need two levels here?
FS-Cache was introduced as an API or front-end for CacheFS, which can be used by any file system driver.</description>

      <description>I would be working on enabling FS-Cache support in the FUSE kernel module, as part of my under graduate project.
Niels De Vos, from Red Hat Engineering, would act as my mentor and guide throughout this project. He would also be presenting this idea in the &amp;lsquo;Linux Plumbers Conference&amp;rsquo; being held in Germany, October 2014.
More details on the the talk can be seen at http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2014/ocw/sessions/2247
This feature has got quite a few requests from the FOSS world, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I could work on this.</description>
