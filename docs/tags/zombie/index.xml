      <description>Why can&amp;rsquo;t I kill a process with the signal 9?
A process can be sleeping in kernel code. Usually that&amp;rsquo;s because of faulty hardware or a badly written driver- or maybe a little of both. A device that isn&amp;rsquo;t set to the interrupt the driver thinks it is can cause this, for example- the driver is waiting for something its never going to get. The process doesn&amp;rsquo;t ignore your signal- it just never gets it.</description>
