# FS-Cache and FUSE


I would be working on enabling FS-Cache support in the FUSE kernel module, as part of my under graduate project.

Niels De Vos, from Red Hat Engineering, would act as my mentor and guide throughout this project. He would also be presenting this idea in the 'Linux Plumbers Conference' being held in Germany, October 2014.

More details on the the talk can be seen at [http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2014/ocw/sessions/2247](http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2014/ocw/sessions/2247)

This feature has got quite a few requests from the FOSS world, and I'm glad I could work on this. For now, I'm trying to get a hold on FS-Cache, how it works with other file systems, and trying to build FUSE with some customizations. Ultimately, it would be the FUSE module were the code additions would go, not FS-Cache.

I'll try to keep this blog updated, so that I have a journal to refer later
