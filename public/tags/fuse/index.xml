    <description><![CDATA[I would be working on enabling FS-Cache support in the FUSE kernel module, as part of my under graduate project.
Niels De Vos, from Red Hat Engineering, would act as my mentor and guide throughout this project. He would also be presenting this idea in the &lsquo;Linux Plumbers Conference&rsquo; being held in Germany, October 2014.
More details on the the talk can be seen at http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2014/ocw/sessions/2247
This feature has got quite a few requests from the FOSS world, and I&rsquo;m glad I could work on this.]]></description>
