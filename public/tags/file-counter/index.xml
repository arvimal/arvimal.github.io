    <description><![CDATA[Most of the scripts presented in this journal have been created while learning bash and having nothing much to do&hellip;
I think its usual to get crazy ideas and work trying to implement them, especially while learning any type of coding. This &lsquo;File Counter&rsquo; script came as such a crazy idea. It was working at the time of its creation, but have not checked it recently.. should work..
This script counts the entire number of files irrespective the folders under the main directory you specify for this script to work on.]]></description>
