    <description><![CDATA[I recently came across a scenario where the objects in a RADOS pool used for an RBD block device doesnâ€™t get removed, even if the files created through the mount point were removed.
I had an RBD image from an RHCS1.3 cluster mapped to a RHEL7.1 client machine, with an XFS filesystem created on it, and mounted locally. Created a 5GB file, and I could see the objects being created in the rbd pool in the ceph cluster.]]></description>
