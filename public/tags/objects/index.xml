    <description><![CDATA[_E_verything in Python is an object, what does that mean? This post tries to discuss some very basic concepts.
What does the following assignment do?
[code language=&ldquo;python&rdquo;]
a = 1 [/code] Of course, anyone dabbled in code knows this. The statement above creates a container `a` and stores the value `1` in it.
