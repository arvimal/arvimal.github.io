<p>FS-Cache and CacheFS. Are there any differences between these two? Initially, I thought both were same. But no, it's not.</p>
<p>CacheFS is the backend implementation which caches the data onto the disk and mainpulates it, while FS-Cache is an interface which talks to CacheFS.</p>
<p>So why do we need two levels here?</p>
<p>FS-Cache was introduced as an API or front-end for CacheFS, which can be used by any file system driver. The file system driver talks with the FS-Cache API which inturn talks with CacheFS in the back-end. Hence, FS-Cache acts as a common interface for the file system drivers without the need to understand the backend CacheFS complexities, and how its implemented.</p>
<p>The only drawback is the additional code that needs to go into each file system driver which needs to use FS-Cache. ie.. Every file system driver that needs to talk with FS-Cache, has to be patched with the support to do so. Moreover, the cache structure differs slightly between file systems using it, and thus lacks a standard. This unfortunately, prevents FS-Cache from being used by every network filesystem out there.</p>
<p>The data flow would be as:</p>
<p><em><strong>VFS &lt;-&gt; File system driver (NFS/CIFS etc..) &lt;-&gt; FS-Cache &lt;-&gt; CacheFS &lt;-&gt; Cached data</strong></em></p>
<p>CacheFS need not cache every file in its entirety, it can also cache files partially. This partial caching mechanism is possible since FS-Cache caches 'pages' rather than an entire file. Pages are smaller fixed-size segments of data, and these are cached depending on how much the files are read initially.</p>
<p>FS-Cache does not require an open file to be loaded in the cache, prior being accessed. This is a nice feature as far as I understand, and the reasons are:</p>
<p>a) Not every open file in the remote file system can be loaded into cache, due to size limits. In such a case, only certain parts (pages) may be loaded. And the rest of the file should be accessed normally over the network.</p>
<p>b) The cache won't necessarily be large enough to hold all the open files on the remote system.</p>
<p>c) Even if the cache is not populated properly, the file should be accessible. ie.. the cache should be able to be bypassed totally.</p>
<p>This hopefully clears the differences between FS-Cache and CacheFS.</p>
