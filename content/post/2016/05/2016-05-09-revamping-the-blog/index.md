I did a revamp of the whole blog two days back. Switching the theme from 'Scrawl' to 'Independent Publisher' was part of it.  This theme is part of the hundreds of free themes in Wordpress, and looks both clean and impressive.

'Independent Publisher' supports random header images from a list, at each page load. I'm using [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for the images. These are free to use and distribute since its released under a [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) licence. I have to say that the images are of superb quality and shows the awesome workmanship behind them.
