# Hugo and WordPress

I've always wanted to move my blog away from WordPress to a static blog generator on Github.

After a few half-hearted attempts over the past years, I've made it finally. 

Of course, the plus points are several. Fast, Markdown, Free, Nice themes :)

But the motivators were entirely different this time. My domain and WordPress subscription was expiring soon, and I had not written as much as I liked in the past few years.  Moreover, editing in the WordPress editor was not something I fancied doing. 

I'm using [HuGo](https://gohugo.io/), and it has been a lovely experience so far. Still learning the ropes, it seems I may need to re-format my posts, especially coming from WordPress.

Looking forward to writing more, this year...
