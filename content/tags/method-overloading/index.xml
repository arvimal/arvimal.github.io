      <description>_I_nheritance is a usual theme in Object Oriented Programming.

In this article, we try to understand some of those features that come up with Inheritance.
We&amp;rsquo;ve discussed Abstract Methods in an earlier post, which is a feature part of Inheritance, and can be applied on child classes that inherits from a Parent class.</description>
