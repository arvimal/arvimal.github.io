      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m still studying Ceph, and recently faced a scenario in which one of my Ceph nodes went down due to hardware failure. Even though my data was safe due to the replication factor, I was not able to remove the node from the cluster.
I could remove the OSDs on the node, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find a way to remove the node being listed in &amp;lsquo;ceph osd tree&amp;rsquo;. I ended up editing the CRUSH map by hand, to remove the host, and uploaded it back.</description>
