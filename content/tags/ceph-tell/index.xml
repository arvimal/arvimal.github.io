      <description>It is possible to change a particular configuration setting in a Ceph cluster dynamically, and I think it is a very neat and useful feature.
Imagine the case where you want to change the replica count of a particular PG from 3 to 4. How would you change this without restarting the Ceph cluster itself? That is where the &amp;lsquo;ceph tell&amp;rsquo; command comes in.
As we saw in the previous post, you can get the list of configuration settings using the administrator socket, from either a monitor or an OSD node.</description>
